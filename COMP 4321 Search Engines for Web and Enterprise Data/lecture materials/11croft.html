<P>
With the enormous increase in recent years in the number of text
databases available on-line, and the consequent need for better
techniques to access this information, there has been a strong
resurgence of interest in the research done in the area of information
retrieval (IR). For many years, IR research was done by a small
community that had little impact on industry. Most applications
of text retrieval focused on bibliographic databases, and the
large information services such as <A HREF="http://www.dialog.com/dialog/dialog1.html">DIALOG</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.westpub.com/hsphome.htm">WESTLAW</A> were
based on standard Boolean logic approaches to text matching and
paid little attention to the results of research on topics such
as retrieval models, query processing, term weighting and relevance
feedback.
<P>
Today, however, the situation is considerably different. Retrieval
techniques based on IR research have found their way into major
information services (for example, <A HREF="http://www.westpub.com/hsphome.htm">West Publishing's</A>
WIN system, <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/individual/description.html">Individual's</A>
clipping service) and the World Wide Web (for example, <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com">InfoSeek</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com">Lycos</A>). Many of the features
once considered too esoteric for the typical user, such as &quot;natural
language&quot; queries, ranked retrieval results, term weighting,
&quot;query-by-example&quot;, and query formulation assistance,
have become common and, indeed, necessary in most IR products
(for example, <A HREF="http://www.pls.com">PLS</A>, <A HREF="http://www.verity.com">Verity</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.fulcrum.com">Fulcrum</A>).
<P>
Given the speed with which industry has adopted the results of
IR research from the 1970s and 1980s, the IR community is faced
with identifying major new directions. The emergence of new applications
such as &quot;digital libraries&quot; is both an opportunity and
a challenge. These applications provide unique opportunities as
testbeds for evaluating and stimulating research, but the challenge
for IR researchers is to define and pursue research programs that
maintain their relevance in a rapidly changing environment. One
problem is that the priorities that IR researchers place on research
issues are not necessarily the same as those of companies and
government agencies that use and sell IR systems. Understanding
those priorities and the operational experience behind them will
be part of the process of deciding which issues are of fundamental
importance and which are more transient.
<P>
In this paper, I summarize the experience of the National Science
Foundation (NSF) Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval
(CIIR) in the area of industrial and government research priorities.
The Center has more than 40 members from the computer and information
industries, applications areas such as medicine and environmental
technology, and a variety of government agencies. These members
participate in a variety of research and technology transfer projects,
and the CIIR supports a number of prototype and operational retrieval
applications, such as <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov">THOMAS</A>
and <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/amhome.html">American Memory at the Library of Congress</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com">InfoSeek</A>, <A HREF="http://www.stat-usa.gov/stat-usa.html">STAT/USA</A>
at the <A HREF="http://www.doc.gov">Department of Commerce</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.support.lotus.com">Lotus Help Desk</A>,
and the <A HREF="http://www-far.npr.gov/VDOB/">U.S. Business Advisor</A>.
<P>
The following list describes ten of the most important issues
we have encountered during our interactions with CIIR members
(apologies to David Letterman). They are listed in approximate
reverse order of importance, based purely on my own assessment.
<H3>10. Relevance Feedback.</H3>

<P>
Relevance feedback is a process where users identify relevant
documents in an initial list of retrieved documents, and the system
then creates a new query based on those sample relevant documents.
Algorithms for automatic relevance feedback have been studied
in IR for more than thirty years, and the research community considers
them to be thoroughly tested and effective. Companies and government
agencies that use IR systems also view relevance feedback as a
desirable feature, but there are some practical difficulties that
have delayed the general adoption of this technique.
<P>
Most of the relevance feedback experiments reported in the IR
literature were based on small test collections of abstract-length
documents. The central problems in relevance feedback are selecting
&quot;features&quot; (words, phrases) from relevant documents
and calculating weights for these features in the context of a
new query. These problems are substantially more difficult in
environments with large databases of full-text documents. In addition,
people searching databases in real applications often use relevance
feedback in different ways than anticipated by IR researchers.
Feedback techniques were developed to improve an initial query
and assumed that a few relevant documents (all those in the top
ten, for example) would be provided. In many real interactions,
however, users specify only a single relevant document. Sometimes
that relevant document may not even be strongly related to the
initial query, and the user is, in effect, browsing using feedback.
<P>
These factors mean that traditional feedback techniques can be
unpredictable in operational settings. Research aimed at correcting
this problem is underway and more operational systems using relevance
feedback can be expected in the near future. Relevance feedback
techniques are also an important part of building profiles in
a routing system (issue 6), with the main difference being the
number of example relevant documents available.
<H3>9. Information Extraction.</H3>

<P>
Information extraction techniques, primarily developed in the
context of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) Message
Understanding Conferences (MUCs), are designed to identify database
entities, attributes and relationships in full text. For example,
for people interested in new joint ventures, an information extraction
system could identify the names of the companies involved, the
new company, the products, and the location, all from articles
coming over a news feed. Companies and government agencies have
considerable interest in these techniques, and see them as contributing
significant &quot;added-value&quot; to the text databases they
and others generate. Potential users also see these techniques
as tools to help with data analysis, browsing, and mining using
text databases. The current state of information extraction tools
is such that it requires a considerable investment to build a
new extraction application, and certain types of information are
very difficult to identify. Research in this area is focused on
reducing the effort required for new applications.
<P>
Extraction of simple categories of information is, on the other
hand, practical and can be an important part of a text-based information
system. Examples of this type of information include company and
other organization names, peoples' names, locations, and dates.
<H3>8. Multimedia Retrieval.</H3>

<P>
Multimedia indexing and retrieval refers to techniques being developed
to access image, video and sound databases without text descriptions.
The perceived value of multimedia information systems is very
high and, consequently, industry has a considerable interest in
the development of these techniques. General solutions to multimedia
indexing are very difficult and, where they currently exist, tend
to be of limited utility. An example of this is indexing images
by their color distribution. This technique can be effectively
used in some applications, such as retrieving pictures of fabric
in specified color shades, but in many other applications simply
cannot be used. Some progress has been made in multimedia indexing
for specific applications (for example, retrieval of photographs
of faces), and in processing language-related multimedia. Examples
of language-related multimedia include text in images, scanned
document images, and speech. Given the number of industrial and
academic research groups working in this area, steady improvement
of the techniques available can be expected.
<H3>7. Effective Retrieval.</H3>

<P>
The development of effective retrieval techniques has been the
core of IR research for more than 30 years. A number of measures
of effectiveness have been proposed, but the most frequently mentioned
are recall and precision. Finding text that satisfies a user's
information need is not simple, and considerable progress has
been made in developing ranking techniques that are significantly
more effective than Boolean logic.
<P>
Contrary to some researchers' opinions, companies that sell and
use IR systems <I>are</I> interested in effectiveness. Having
a more effective retrieval engine is a major selling point. It
is not, however, the primary focus of their concerns and I have
indicated this by the quite low ranking of this issue in the top
10. With regard to effectiveness, companies are particularly interested
in techniques that produce significant improvements (rather than
a few percent average precision) and that avoid occasional major
mistakes. A system that performs well on most queries but makes
it difficult for users to recover from bad mistakes, or even understand
why they were made, is likely to be considered unacceptable. These
occasional mistakes have very little impact on the average recall/precision
measures used in standard IR tests, but considerable impact on
end users. An example of a technique that produces reliable (although
small) improvements in effectiveness, is generally well-regarded
by users, but is one of the main sources of occasional bad mistakes
is stemming. Solutions include building better stemmers and doing
stemming as part of query processing rather than indexing.
<H3>6. Routing and Filtering.</H3>

<P>
Information routing, filtering and clipping are all synonyms used
to describe the process of identifying relevant documents in streams
of information such as news feeds. Instead of comparing a single
query to large numbers of archived documents, as is the case for
IR, large number of archived profiles are compared to individual
documents. Documents that match are sent to the users associated
with the profile. A profile is a representation of a long-term
information need and is usually more complex than a session-based
query.
<P>
Companies and government agencies often indicate that routing
is the main function required for a text-based system, with IR
being a backup, secondary function. Given that, we can expect
to see a significant increase in the use of routing systems.
<P>
Both efficiency and effectiveness are important for routing, and
both have to be addressed in different ways than IR systems. Efficiency
is important in order to deal with high-volume document streams
(e.g. 100 MB/hour) and large numbers of profiles (tens of thousands).
New indexing and memory-based architectures are being developed
for these systems. In terms of effectiveness, the basic algorithms
are very similar to retrieval but instead of producing a ranking,
cutoffs must be used to separate relevant from non-relevant documents.
Learning techniques are being studied both as a means of determining
these cutoffs and automatically building profiles based on user
feedback.
<H3>5. Interfaces and Browsing.</H3>

<P>
Effective interfaces for text-based information systems are a
high priority for users of these systems. The interface is a major
part of how a system is evaluated, and as the retrieval and routing
algorithms become more complex to improve recall and precision,
more stress is placed on the design of interfaces that make the
system easy to use and understandable. Interfaces must support
a range of functions including query formulation, presentation
of retrieved information, feedback, and browsing. The challenge
is present this sophisticated functionality in a conceptually
simple way. Despite the importance of this issue, there has been
relatively little relevant research done by either the IR or human-computer
interface (HCI) communities. This, however, is changing and much
more work on interfaces for information systems and information
visualization will be appearing.
<H3>4. &quot;Magic&quot;.</H3>

<P>
One of the major causes of failures in IR systems is vocabulary
mismatch. This means that the information need is often described
using different words than are found in relevant documents. Techniques
that address this problem by automatic expansion of the query
are often regarded as a form of &quot;magic&quot; by users and
are viewed as highly desirable. Vocabulary expansion can result
from transforming the document and query representations, as with
Latent Semantic Indexing, or it can be done as a form of automatic
thesaurus built by corpus analysis. Further research in this area
will make these techniques more reliable and efficient.
<H3>3. Efficient, Flexible Indexing and Retrieval.</H3>

<P>
One of the most frequently mentioned, and most highly rated, issues
is efficiency. Many different aspects of a system can have an
impact on efficiency, and metrics such as query response time
and indexing speed are major concerns of virtually every company
involved with text-based systems. In the past, efficiency was
a secondary issue in much of the IR literature. This has changed
with the increased accessibility of large, full-text databases
and new algorithms designed to increase indexing and query speed
are published regularly. There has also been substantial research
on text compression algorithms for decreasing storage overheads
and I/O times. New applications of text-based systems that involve
real-time and multi-user constraints will also require more work
on concurrency control, update, and recovery strategies appropriate
for these applications. Web-based systems, such as Infoseek, have
particularly strict efficiency requirements since they must deal
with hundreds of! thousands of queries per day.
<P>
The other aspect of indexing that is considered very important
is the capability of handling a wide variety of document formats.
This includes both standards such as SGML, HTML, Acrobat, and
WordPerfect to name a few, as well as the myriad formats used
in text-based applications such as medicine, law, commerce, etc.
<H3>2. Distributed IR.</H3>

<P>
With the advent of the World-Wide Web and the huge increase in
the use of the Internet, there has been a corresponding increase
in demand for text retrieval systems that can work in distributed,
wide-area network environments. This demand also comes from groupware
applications such as Lotus Notes, which facilitate the rapid creation
of databases distributed throughout an organization. One problem
of this type is addressed by Web search engines, such as Infoseek
and Lycos, which index Web pages and provide access to them. The
more general problems are locating the best databases to search
in a distributed environment that may contain hundreds or even
thousands of databases, and merging the results that come back
from the distributed search. The results must be merged in order
to produce the overall ranking of retrieved items, instead of
a collection of individual rankings. The difficulty of doing this
effectively comes from the fact that the individual rankings may
be incompatible in the sense that the numbers used to produce
these rankings may not be directly comparable (they may even come
from different IR systems). Research addressing these issues has
begun to appear in the major conferences.
<P>
The work in this area, and that done in routing and relevance
feedback, is closely related to the work on multi-agent systems
that has received a lot of attention.
<H3>1. Integrated Solutions.</H3>

<P>
The most important problem from the point of view of companies
using and selling text-based systems is integration with other
systems. A text retrieval system is a tool that can be used to
solve part of an organization's information management problems.
It is not often, however, the complete solution. Typically, a
complete solution requires other text-based tools such as routing
and extraction, tools for handling multimedia and scanned documents
such as OCR, a database management system for structured data,
and workflow or other groupware systems for managing documents
and their use in the organization. Currently, these systems must
be integrated using customized software, and even then the integration
is often very superficial. More work on standardized architectures
and common platforms is needed. Examples of some of the standards
efforts include the Z39.50 search protocol, the SQL-Multimedia
proposals, and the ARPA TIPSTER architecture for integrating retrieval,
routing, and extraction systems.
<P>
One of the most important aspects of developing common platforms
is the integration of database management and IR systems. An effective
integration of these systems, together with multimedia capabilities,
would provide an information system that could be used to manage
many of the applications that currently exist. Although partial
solutions to this integration do exist, they do not address one
of the fundamental issues, which is that database systems all
retrieve using Boolean logic, whereas both text and multimedia
require techniques involving uncertainty and ranking for effective
retrieval. True integration of text and multimedia is likely to
require significant changes in the standard database techniques
for indexing and query optimization, and may even require new
query languages. Research on these issues is underway and more
effort and support for this work is likely.
<P>

<P>
This list of ten issues is not meant to be comprehensive. There
are other research areas that are of significant interest to companies,
such as multilingual IR, data mining in text databases, and text
categorization (attaching categories to text from predefined set,
such as news categories or diagnosis codes). Although the ranking
of these issues may not coincide with the priorities that IR researchers
(including myself) may put on their own research programs, there
is almost total agreement that these issues all pose significant
research challenges. Some of these challenges will be solved in
the short-term, but others will be the basis of longer research
projects. The opportunities and experience provided by the explosion
of operational text-based systems will be invaluable for IR research.
