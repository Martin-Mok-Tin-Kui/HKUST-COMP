<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">COMP 4441 Computer Music</span></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lab 4: Wavetable Synthesis and Score Input</span></h1>
<hr>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p align="left">In this lab, you will synthesize instrument tones using 
wavetable synthesis and input a simple score.</p>
<h2>Synthesize tones using wavetable synthesis</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You may start your lab on <a href="sinewave.orc">sinewave.orc</a> and
	<a href="sinewave.sco">sinewave.sco</a>.</li>
	<li>You are required to synthesize a <a href="045-a-short.wav">organ tone</a>.</li>
	<li>Use PVan+ to get the amplitudes of the first 10 harmonics when the 
	peak RMS amplitude is reached (The &quot;Peak RMS Amp&quot; option is chosen).</li>
	<li>Construct a wavetable in the score file.</li>
	<li>You may test the synthesized notes by inputting some notes in the score 
	files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pitch-class and cpspch</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Looking up the frequency of each note is a tedious work. Pitch-class and
	<a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cpspch.html">cpspch</a> can be 
	used to due with this issue.</li>
	<li>Function <a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cpspch.html">cpspch</a> 
	takes a pitch-class value and return a corresponding frequency in Hertz.</li>
	<li>A pitch-class consist of a decimal number in a format of yy.xx.</li>
	<li>yy represent the octave number of a note (8 represent the octave of C4).</li>
	<li>xx is a number from 0 to 11 represent the note order in a octave 
	starting with C (e.g. C4 =&gt; 8.00, C#4 =&gt; 8.01, D4 =&gt; 8.02 .... B4 =&gt; 8.11).</li>
	<li>You can look up the pitch-class of each note from this
	<a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MiscPitch.html">table</a>.</li>
	<li>Modify the orc file such that we can input p5 as a pitch-class value 
	instead of frequency in Hertz.</li>
	<li>The final orc file should look like <a href="song.orc">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simple Score Input</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When you need to input a note in this assignment, you have to figure out 
	7 parameters (p1 to p7).</li>
	<li>For p1(i1), p4(amp, is given), p6(attack, is given) and p7(decay, is 
	given), you should have no problems to figure out.</li>
	<li>For p2(start) and p3(duration), please refer to P.14 of lecture note
	<a href="../../notes/rhythm.ppt">Rhythm</a> to 
	figure out the way to deduce from a score.</li>
	<li>For p5(pitch), please refer to lecture note
	<a href="../../notes/pitch.ppt">Pitch</a> to figure 
	out the way to deduce the pitch of a note from a score. Then look up the 
	pitch class from the pitch-class
	<a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MiscPitch.html">table</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2 align="left">Lab Assignment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Synthesize the organ tone using the skills learned 
	in lab2.</p>
  </li>
	<li>
    <p align="left">Add cpspch function such that we can input pitch-class in p5 
	instead of frequency in Hertz.</p>
  </li>
	<li>Input the following score with <a href="045-a-short.wav">organ</a>. <em>(It is okay if you did the previous version, which was harder.)</em>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="score.png"></p>
	<li>Set the tempo to 145 beat per minute. Refer to lecture notes <a href="../../notes/amplitude.ppt">Amplitude</a> slides 22-26 about the tempo statement.</li>
  </li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The final score should sound like <a href="song.wav">this</a>. This is a selection from the piece "<strong>Gran Vals</strong>", which you can watch a full peformance here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsp6dR-fL4A" target="_blank">Gran Vals - Francisco TÃ¡rrega</a>. Enjoy!</li>
	<li>
    <p align="left">Re-name the final files as <b>song.orc</b> and <b>song.sco</b>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

System</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS">If you have finished your assignment
and demonstrated to your TAs, you don't need to submit your files to
CASS. But if you don't attend the labs or you
cannot finish the assignment in the lab, you need to submit the source
code using the
<a href="../../../cass/submit.html">CASS</a>. </font>

<h2><font face="Arial Unicode MS">Demonstration and Submission</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS">Please submit your files using
<a href="../../../cass/submit.html">CASS</a> by <b>Monday (27-Oct-2014)</b>. For any questions, please contact
your TAs by email (<b>*Only for question asking. Submissions please go to CASS.*</b> ronmo@cse.ust.hk, bwuaa@cse.ust.hk).
 DO NOT submit the wav file; submitting the orc and sco
files will be enough. Thank you.
