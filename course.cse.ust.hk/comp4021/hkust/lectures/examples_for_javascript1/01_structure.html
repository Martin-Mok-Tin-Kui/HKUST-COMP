  <title>Example of a simple JavaScript page</title>

  <!-- We put javascript inside a tag called "script". 
  
   We also need to tell the browser the type of the script.
   Set either the attribute "language" to "javascript" or
   the attribute "type" to "text/javascript" (or both).
   The standard is to set type="text/javascript"
   -->

  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">

  <!-- It is a common practice to enclose the script area inside an HTML comment 
  // to hide it from browsers that don't understand JavaScript

	document.write("Welcome!");

   // end of comment area -->
  </script>



</head>

<body>
<p>
This is the first text line of the HTML page.
The browser will look at JavaScript which is in the head 
part of the page before it looks at the first line of html text.
</p>
</body>
